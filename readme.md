    Explore the entire classification pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, within a reproducible and interactive Jupyter environment.
*   **User-Friendly Web Application**
    Interact with the trained classification model through a simple, intuitive web interface, allowing for easy image uploads and instant predictions.
*   **Comprehensive Dataset Management**
    Utilize an organized `dataset` directory for efficient storage and access of animal images, facilitating robust model training and validation.
*   **Detailed Project Documentation**
    Refer to the `Image Classification of animals.pdf` for an in-depth understanding of the project's methodology, architecture, and results.


## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Animal Classification project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   git (for cloning the repository)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the `animal-classification` repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vtandon1204/animal-classification.git
    cd animal-classification
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required Python packages using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Download the Dataset (if not included)**
    The project expects an organized `dataset` directory. If it's not present or incomplete, you may need to download the animal image dataset used for training. (Further instructions for dataset download may be required here if the dataset is external or very large).


## üí° Usage Examples

Once installed, you can interact with the project in two main ways: via the Jupyter Notebook for development and exploration, or through the web application for inference.

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

To explore the model training, evaluation, and data preprocessing steps, launch the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook from the project root:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open `classification.ipynb` in your browser. You can then run cells sequentially to see the classification model in action.

### Running the Web Application

To use the trained model through the web interface:

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the address displayed in your terminal).
4.  You can then upload an image of an animal and receive a classification prediction.



## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

The `animal-classification` project is continuously evolving. Here are some of the planned features and improvements:

*   **V1.1 - Enhanced Model Accuracy**
    *   Implement advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet).
    *   Experiment with various data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
*   **V1.2 - Expanded Animal Categories**
    *   Integrate support for a wider range of animal species, requiring dataset expansion and model retraining.
    *   Add a user interface feature to suggest new categories.
*   **V1.3 - Deployment & Scalability**
    *   Explore containerization with Docker for easier deployment.
    *   Investigate cloud deployment options (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable inference.
*   **Future Enhancements**
    *   Add real-time classification capabilities (e.g., via webcam).
    *   Implement a feedback mechanism for users to correct misclassifications.
    *   Improve UI/UX of the web application.


## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the `animal-classification` project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

### Code Style

*   Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
*   Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
*   Include clear and concise comments where necessary.

### Branching Conventions

*   All new features or bug fixes should be developed in a dedicated branch.
*   Branch names should be descriptive, e.g., `feature/add-new-model`, `bugfix/fix-upload-error`.
*   Do not commit directly to the `main` branch.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Create a new branch** from `main`.
3.  **Commit your changes** with clear, concise commit messages.
4.  **Push** your branch to your forked repository.
5.  **Open a Pull Request** (PR) to the `main` branch of the upstream repository.
6.  Ensure your PR description clearly explains the changes and their purpose.
7.  Address any feedback or review comments promptly.

### Testing Requirements

*   If you add new features, please include relevant unit tests to ensure functionality.
*   Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a Pull Request.
